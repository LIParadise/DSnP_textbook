some notes:
-- trade-off:
     given a ckt, from PI to prove -> divide-and-counter the whole circuit, but take time.
                  from PO to prove -> benefitial to this project, since some circuit is 
                                      just an xor to exactly the same ckt. Just one SAT run
                                      would simpilify this whole ckt to just one gate.
-- SAT:
     SAT engine would learn some facts.
     Given an FEC group with many gates, it's very possible that the given two gate in the
     group we want to test if they are the same have many AAG that's exactly the same. Thus 
     we don't want to destroy the SAT model when testing given group.
-- misc:
     -- it's preferable that we build an DFS list from PI to PO to run FRAIG.
     -- when running FRAIG, we may want to merge the ckt when discovered they are exactly 
        the same, or we may want to merge later. Since we need to modify some list.
     -- we may want to set an limit when trying to merge two gate in some FEC.
